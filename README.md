# library-of-funstuff

Hello,
Just starting out in this kind of thing.  Was in electrronics mfg for several years in Redmond, WA.  Getting back into stuff as a hobby(Raspberry Pi, simulations of circuit designs)  I made the decision to 'bite the bullet' and explore Linux.  Used PuppyLinux first, liked it and decided to install a full Linux distro.  I am running Debian right now.  I gave Mint Ubuntu a try and Manjaro.  Mint couldn't do what I needed to do for tutorials of the command line.  Manjaro is okay I guess.  I decided to stay with Debian.  It does pretty much everything I need.  I am SO GLAD to abandon Microsoft Windows :)
